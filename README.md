# ðŸ“± Digital Mirror: Modeling the Impact of Social Media on Self-Esteem

This repository showcases my individual contribution to a collaborative academic project titled:

> **"Digital Mirror: A Glimpse into Smartphone Use and Mental Health"**

The project investigates how social media usage correlates with self-esteem, using data collected through a structured questionnaire and analyzed using **Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Research Question

**Does social media negatively affect self-esteem?**

- **Dependent Variable (D1)**: Self-reported impact on self-esteem (Yes/No)
- **Independent Variables**: Age, frequency of FOMO, comparison with others, platform usage, satisfaction.

## ðŸ‘¤ My Contributions

- ðŸ§¾ Developed the survey instrument (questionnaire)
- ðŸ”¢ Conducted **GLM analysis** in Python (using `statsmodels`)
- ðŸ”¥ Created **conditional probability heatmaps** and **network diagrams**
- ðŸ“„ Interpreted model summary, p-values, coefficients, and fit statistics
- ðŸ“‰ Built a directed acyclic graph (DAG) mapping hypothesized relationships

## ðŸ“Š Model Highlights

- **Pseudo R-squared**: 0.5564
- **Significant Predictors**:
  - Q1: Frequency of FOMO â€” p = 0.006
  - Q2: Belief that social media affects mental health â€” p = 0.001
- **Non-significant Predictors**: Age, platform used, pressure to conform.
